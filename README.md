# Cng
Pronounced See Engine - meaning C next generation

Cng is a new language conceived as a natural evolution of C retaining applicability to system engineering with determinism, simplicity, and performance while improving power, reliability, and security. Ultimately the new intrinsics should actually improve performance over C by allowing the compilers to make better defined assumptions about the functional constraints.
